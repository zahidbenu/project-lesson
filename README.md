# Project lesson

This is an Educational landing page.

This project I have created as a practice exercise for RRF-Batch-2025. I have used HTML, CSS3 and jQuery to develop this website. It's responsive  across all devices and designed with attention to UI/UX best practices, ensuring a clean layout, smooth interactivity, and accessibility for users. 

## Live Demo

Here is the live link of the site:

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - For structuring the content and layout of the website.
- **CSS3** - CSS3 features like flexbox, media queries, transitions, and custom properties (variables) were used to create a layout that adapts across devices while providing smooth visual effects and a clean user experience.
- **Jquery** - Implemented to add interactivity and dynamic functionality with animation.
